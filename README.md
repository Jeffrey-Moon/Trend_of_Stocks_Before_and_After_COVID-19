# Analysis of Stock Trends Before and After COVID-19 Pandemic

## Overview

This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on major stocks, using advanced analytical and AI techniques to predict stock trends during similar future events. The project includes the collection and analysis of stock data, as well as the development of predictive models to forecast stock movements in response to pandemic-like crises.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Stock data from major companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and others were collected from Yahoo Finance for the period before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Data Analysis**: The project utilized various statistical methods and technical indicators, including moving averages, Bollinger Bands, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), to analyze stock price movements.
- **Predictive Modeling**: AI-based models were developed to predict stock price trends, leveraging historical data to simulate possible outcomes during similar future events.

## Key Components

### Technical Analysis
The analysis included calculating technical indicators such as:
- **Moving Averages (MA)**: To smooth out price data and identify the direction of the trend.
- **Bollinger Bands**: To measure market volatility and identify overbought or oversold conditions.
- **RSI and MACD**: To assess the strength of the stock price movement and potential reversals.

### Predictive Modeling
The project explored various machine learning algorithms and statistical models to predict stock movements, focusing on:
- **Time Series Analysis**: To model and forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Regression Models**: To predict stock returns and assess the impact of market factors.

## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed significant volatility and market shifts during the pandemic, with predictive models showing potential for accurate forecasting in similar future crises. The project's findings contribute to better understanding market dynamics under stress and help in strategic decision-making.

## Future Work

- **Model Enhancement**: Improve the accuracy of predictions by incorporating additional market indicators and alternative data sources.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring stock market trends and making predictions based on live data.
